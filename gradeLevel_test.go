	"Existing computer programs that measure readability are based largely upon subroutines which estimate " + 
		"number of syllables, usually by counting vowels. The shortcoming in estimating syllables is that " +
		"it necessitates keypunching the prose into the computer. There is no need to estimate syllables " +
		"since word length in letters is a better predictor of readability than word length in syllables. " +
		"Therefore, a new readability formula was computed that has for its predictors letters per 100 words " +
		"and sentences per 100 words. Both predictors can be counted by an optical scanning device, and thus " +
		"the formula makes it economically feasible for an organization such as the U.S. Office of Education to " +
		"calibrate the readability of all textbooks for the public school system.",
	"Flesch Grade Level Readability Formula improves upon the Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula. " +
		"Rudolph Flesch, an author, writing consultant, and the supporter of Plain English Movement, " +
		"is the co-author of this formula along with John P. Kincaid. Thatâ€™s why it is also called Flesch-Kincaid " +
		"Grade Level Readability Test. Raised in Austria, Flesch studied law and earned a Ph.D. " +
		"in English from the Columbia University. Flesch, through his writings and speeches, advocated a return to phonics. " +
		"In his article, A New Readability Yardstick, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1948, Flesch proposed " +
		"the Reading Ease Readability Formula. ",
